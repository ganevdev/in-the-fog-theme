# In The Fog - VS Code Theme

![In The Fog - VS Code Theme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ganevru/in-the-fog-theme/master/assets/in-the-fog-screen.png)

This is dark, green and flat theme, focused primarily on web development. The main idea of this theme is to reduce the visibility of all the least important elements of the vs code interface so that it would be easier for you to focus on the code.

In The Fog Theme:

- Here, there are no borderlines separating interface elements.
- Almost everything uses the same background color.
- For the code, calm, but at the same time, contrast and distinguishable colors are used.
- Auxiliary elements of VS code, such as, say, an element showing the number of modified files in git, do not try to attract attention.

Colors are mainly based on the [Slime Them](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=smlombardi.slime).

The syntax is similar to the syntax of the [New Moon Syntax Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=taniarascia.new-moon-vscode)

Font: [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)
